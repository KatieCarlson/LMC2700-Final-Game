					<h2> Entry M1: Is it Love?</h2>
                    <p>Saw her again. Turns out she joined the art club today. Small world, huh? I didn’t take her to be interested in art, but it’s something I can talk to her about I suppose. Not really something I’d normally be too excited about, but between my strange feelings and the odd interaction I had with her during free drawing period, it seems I really can’t help but get anxious...
                    I mean, she recognized me and greeted me by name, like, what? I don’t recall ever formally introducing myself at all before, but she was sat at my table and we got to work. Free drawing period today, so I was working on the bullet journal- need to put some more flourishes on the title page for next month’s section. 
                    She leaned over the table, and just kinda stared at it for a little while. 						<a onClick="j1options();" style="cursor: pointer; cursor: hand; color:dimgray; " id="option">___________</a>  To be honest, it was a little awkward, since I was conscious of her staring. Eventually, I looked up, I figured she needed something from me at the time, and asked her about it. <span style="background-color:#bbede8">
                        <a onmouseover="j2option1over();" onmouseout="j2out();"style="cursor: pointer;"> Turns out she was actually interested in my bullet journal; she thought it looked pretty cool.</a></span> (finally, someone who gets it!) 
                    Anyway, she started getting pretty into it, we talked for a while afterwards about it, and I gave her some tips to get started. Felt pretty good about today honestly.
                    . . .
                    I think I like this girl. I...I don’t know why, but there’s a strange feeling in my chest when I speak to her, like there’s some pressure on my heart. Oh man...what do I do?
